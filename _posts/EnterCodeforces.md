### “Codeforces' aim is to offer you a convenient platform to organize, run and discuss programming contests. It will be a bit of a social network website, more than a news portal and more than an online judge. Being absolutely independent from me, you will be able to organize and run a contest. You will decide on your own if to make it open to the whole world or if it will be a contest for your University only. And if you're not interested in this, you might discuss the news in the contest world - read/write blogs, discuss topics, and support your dearest and nearest.”

-Mike Mirzayanov, founder and CEO of Codeforces

Codeforces is a popular platform for competitive programming. It's known for its contests and community interactions through blogs and discussions. Contests are divided into several divisions: Division 4 is the least difficult, and Division 1 is the most challenging. Problems are labeled with letters (A, B, C, etc.) to show increasing difficulty and are given numerical ratings to show their complexity. Participants can use various programming languages supported by the platform to solve these problems by either uploading a file or pasting their code into the source code section of the submit tab.

Unlike some other platforms like CodeChef or LeetCode, Codeforces doesn't have an inbuilt online Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development, like writing, testing, and debugging code.

During contests, participants' performance is evaluated based on the number of problems they solve and any penalties they get for incorrect submissions. This evaluation determines their rank and rating on the platform. Participants are awarded titles based on their rating, ranging from "Newbie" to "Legendary Grandmaster."

Here are some steps for getting started.

First, consider downloading a code editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). While I recommend VSCode, you might find another editor that suits you better.

Python is often recommended for beginners because it’s simple to learn and use. Many competitive programmers prefer C++ because it's faster and has built-in libraries like the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides ready-to-use functions and data structures.

Make sure your compiler or interpreter is set up correctly to avoid errors.

Compiler and Interpreter are two different ways to translate a program from programming or scripting language to machine language.  A compiler takes the entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also referred to as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++.

An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python, and Matlab.

You might also find it helpful to install extensions like Competitive Companion, which helps in parsing contest questions, and Github Copilot, which assists with code completion.

If you're just starting, you might be able to solve the easiest problems in Divisions 3 and 4 contests with basic programming skills. Aim to solve problems rated between 800-1000 to build your intuition (your natural understanding) and implementation skills (how you write and execute your code).

As you become more comfortable, try solving the same questions more quickly. Progressing to more advanced techniques like brute force and greedy algorithms can be beneficial.

Another name for brute force is exhaustive search. In these algorithms, you consider every possible solution in the solution domain to find the optimal solution. Depending on the type of problem that you are doing, if you have n items to consider you will be either doing n! searches (Permutations) or 2n searches (Combinations). Brute force algorithms are simple to implement but computationally intensive to run. They are reasonable solutions when n is small but even for moderately large values of n the solutions become too intensive to produce results in a reasonable time frame. One advantage of brute force algorithms is that they give the optimal solution, while greedy algorithms are simple, straightforward, and short-sighted. They are easy to implement and sometimes produce results that we can live with. In a greedy algorithm, you are always looking for the immediate gain without considering the long-term effect. Even though you get short-term gains with a greedy algorithm, it does not always produce the optimal solution.

At this stage, you might tackle problems ranging from A-C in Division 3 and problems from A-B in Division 2.

From there, delve into advanced topics like prefix sums (prefix sum, cumulative sum, inclusive scan, or simply scan of a sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, ... is a second sequence of numbers y0, y1, y2, ..., the sums of prefixes (running totals) of the input sequence), two-pointers (Iterating two monotonic pointers across an array to search for a pair of indices satisfying some condition in linear time), and frequency tables (A frequency table is a way to analyze the way the data is distributed across different values). With consistent practice, you'll be able to tackle progressively more challenging problems and improve your rating on Codeforces.

Competitive programming offers many benefits, including potential job opportunities with competitive salaries.
