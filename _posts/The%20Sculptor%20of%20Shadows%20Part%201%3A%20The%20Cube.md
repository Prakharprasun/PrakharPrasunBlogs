As you moved further into the hallway, navigating between the rusty handrails and over the wobbling bridge, you could
see the cube of one of his victims. Obsidian black with blood splatters on top, the child's cube hadn't disintegrated
yet, still surviving despite the myriad of trauma he caused them...

The cube, the mysterious big sphere, multiple killings, and a legacy of shadows. Dive into my story to uncover the
secrets behind it all...

I'm thrilled to announce my upcoming three-part series, The Sculptor of Shadows:

The Sculptor of Shadows: Part 1 - The Cube (currently ongoing!)

The Sculptor of Shadows: Part 2 - The Killing Spree

The Sculptor of Shadows: Part 3 - The Big Sphere


Stay tuned for new chapters. I can't wait to share this journey with you all. Keep an eye out for updates!
